- Creation of javascript, ECMA a independent standardizing company set standards to javascript so it can be used 
    eveywhere on the web browser. THAT standardised javaScript was called ECMAScript or ES1
    ECMAScript or ES1
- ES1 got an update on 20015 and is called ES6  //the biggest update to the language ever!
- there's annual releases for ECMAScript or ES2016, ES2017 till the end of time. According to this guys, it's ES2089. How old will i be? 
- JS or ES is backword compatible!
- ES6+ is all modern browsers ie 2015 and now. Transpiling, polyfilling (these won't work on older?)
- Compatiblility table?
    - When new techniques are presented, people will implement them before being released. 
        -there are 4 stages. Once an idea is in stage 3, it's mostly garanteed that it will go through.
