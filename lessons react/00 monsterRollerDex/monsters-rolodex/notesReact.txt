    difference between a class and a function
    class App extends Components{
        render(){
            your logic
        }
    }
    vs
    function App(){
        your logic
    }

    classes vs hooks
        -Hooks seems like a new method that could be used instead of classes.
        "fuctional components with hooks" -is the modern way to write react? vid 27, time 1:05
    
    Over view of react
        -package.json is where all the packages are saved. 
        -[src]-index.js         //is the main app launched (root) 
            root.render(
                        <React.StrictMode>
                        <App />             <--- here is our app 
                        </React.StrictMode>
                        );

        -[public]-index.html        //is the container? Similar to razor pages. 
        -[src]-App.js       //is where you write your logic?

How to use npm or npx
https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/29209634#overview
    npm i -g packagename (-g means installing gloabally)
    npm list -g packagename //will show you were it is installed. 
with npx you install use and delete right away. (Not sure why that's used for building react app...)

-npm build //???
-npm run eject???
