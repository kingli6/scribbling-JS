BLOCK SCOPE (ES6/JS)
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22648481#overview 
    -Variables are accessible only inside block (block scoped)
    -However, this only applies to let and const variables. 
        var is accessible anywhere?????
    -Functions are also block scoped (only in 'strict mode';)   timestamp 6:30 
        does this mean otherwise, you have access?
